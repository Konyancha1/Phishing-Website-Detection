# Phishing URL Detection Chrome Extension

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Chrome extension for real-time detection of phishing URLs using machine learning. The extension integrates a Flask backend server with XGboost machine learning model to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate.

## Features
- Detects phishing URLs in real-time while browsing the web.
- Provides users with instant feedback on the legitimacy of URLs.
- Seamless integration with the Chrome browser for ease of use.

## Installation
To install the Chrome extension, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer mode.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory.

## Usage
